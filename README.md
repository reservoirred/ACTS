Automated XCT segmentation https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2020.101460
This is code relevant for the ACTS tool (Automated Computed Tomography Segmentation) for X-ray computed tomogrpay data sets. 
The link to the paper I, and gratefully others, have published is provided. The paper details the methodology for building, training and testing the ACTS tool. 
The code provided in this repository is free to use under condition that you cite the given article. 
The code provided allows for OTSU tranform of image stacks, training your own ACTS network on a data set, and using ACTS to segment other data.  A pre-trained ACTS neural network can be provided if asked.
